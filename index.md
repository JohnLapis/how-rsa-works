### decryption {#section-2}

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$.

Now a inline math with special character: $|\psi\rangle$, $x'$, $x^\*$.

Test a display math:
$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
$$
  \begin{align}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
  \end{align}
$$
Is it O.K.?
